# Machine-Learning-By-Hand

Python libraries like Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow 2, it is incredibly easy to deploy machine learning models.
However, as an introduction to machine learning, it is important to understand the intricacies and details of how functions are derived and how the different parts work together. And, to understand what happens behind the scenes when using tools like TensorFlow.

This project is an attempt to utilize and apply concepts that I have learned. This learning has come from many sources, some noteable ones are:

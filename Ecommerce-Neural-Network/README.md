# Neural Network "By Hand"
## Intro
The goal for this project is to apply my learning and create a neural network without the use of libraries like Tensorflow and Scikit in order to help understand how machine learning works. Additionally, I want to compare logistic regression and neural networks using the same ecommerce dataset.

## The Data
The data in this project is an ecommerce dataset feature in the course ["Data Science: Deep Learning and Neural Networks in Python" by The Lazy Programmer](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-deep-learning-in-python/)

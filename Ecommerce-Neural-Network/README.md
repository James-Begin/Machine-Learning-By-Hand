# Neural Network "By Hand"
## Intro
The goal for this project is to apply my learning and create a neural network without the use of libraries like Tensorflow and Scikit in order to help understand how machine learning works. Additionally, I want to compare logistic regression and neural networks using the same ecommerce dataset.

## The Data
The data in this project is an ecommerce dataset feature in the course ["Data Science: Deep Learning and Neural Networks in Python" by The Lazy Programmer](https://www.udemy.com/course/data-science-deep-learning-in-python/) and can be found on [Github](https://github.com/lazyprogrammer/machine_learning_examples/blob/master/ann_logistic_extra/ecommerce_data.csv). The dataset is meant to replicate a real world data from an online store. The set contains 6 categories and 500 data points in each category. The categories include whether the user is on a mobile device (Binary), the # of products viewed (Continuous), visit duration (Continuous), whether the user has visited before (Binary), time of day (Categorical). The final category is the user action (Categorical) and will act as the targets for the neural network.
